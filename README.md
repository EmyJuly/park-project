Hello everyone, and welcome to our project presentation.

The population in cities these days is growing rapidly, which leads to increased traffic congestion. One of the solutions we can implement to alleviate this issue is by making parking spaces smarter. This can significantly help urban residents save time and reduce traffic jams.

In this project, we’ve integrated several files, including image files, to showcase our approach.


CarParkProject Abstract

Objective:

Develop a parking spot monitoring system using computer vision to efficiently track and analyze parking availability, aiding in better resource distribution and congestion management.



Key Components:

Image Processing Algorithms: Analyze video feeds to locate parking spots and determine occupancy status. Image Preprocessing: Enhance picture quality and reduce noise. Thresholding and Morphological Procedures: Segregate parking spaces and assess occupancy. Visualization Tools: Display parking occupancy statistics for easy understanding and utilization. Benefits:

Real-Time Monitoring: Provides up-to-date information on parking spot availability and occupancy rates. Scalable and Cost-Effective: Enhances traditional parking management systems. Applications: Useful in smart cities, transportation management, and commercial parking facilities. Technological Impact: Utilizes computer vision and intelligent data analytics to optimize parking management, contributing to more sustainable and advanced urban environments.

Keywords: Parking space monitoring, computer vision, image processing, occupancy detection, parking management.

   
In conclusion, this project effectively demonstrates the integration and manipulation of image files to detect parking spaces. By running our code in PyCharm, we validated our methods for identifying and restoring spots, ensuring accurate detection of free and occupied spaces through pixel value analysis.

This automated process can significantly enhance parking management systems by providing real-time updates on available spaces, ultimately making parking more efficient and user-friendly.
